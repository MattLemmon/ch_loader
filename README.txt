$ ch_loader.rb
  loads the Chingu Examples from a Main Menu.

_____________________________________________________________


GLOBAL CONTROLS:

Esc =  Exit            
 Q  =  Main Menu       
 W  =  Previous Menu   
 F  =  Fart Feature    
 Z  =  Status Log   

So far it loads Examples 1-4, and Examples 5-8 are stubbed in. 

_____________________________________________________________


PROJECT GOALS:

1.  Move all the example files into the /ch_examples folder.
    I think $LOAD_PATH needs to be specified in order to
    accomplish this....
                        COMPLETED!  I figured it out!! Yes!!

                        Thanks to lol_o2 for pointing me in 
                        the right direction on this.

2.  Add more examples.
                        PENDING...

3.  Improve user interface.
                        PENDING...

4.  Add arrow-toggling of example selections.
                        NOTHING YET.

5.  Add Welcome GameState.
                        COMPLETED!

6.  Upgrade Fart Feature.
                        NOTHING YET.


BUGS TO FIX:

1.  Problem with title loading (@descr).    FIXED!!!

2.  Problem with $window.caption-loading.
    (Loads captions at wrong times).
                                            NOTHING YET.
